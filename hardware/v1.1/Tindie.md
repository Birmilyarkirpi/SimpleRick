These are surplus PCBs from my first prototype. Iâ€™m selling these to anyone who is interested in working with the SimpleRick hardware before the production version is available.

These were manufactured by JLC PCB with the following specifications:

- 4 layers
- 1.6mm board thickness
- green soldermask
- ENIG surface finish

As of 8/3/18, 8 PCBs are available.

To assemble this PCB, you will need to acquire and solder all the components yourself. You should be comfortable with soldering these component sizes:

- 0603 passives
- SOT-23
- QFN 0.8 mm pitch
- SOP 0.6 mm pitch

You may find it helpful to use a stencil when applying solder paste. Gerber files are provided in case you want to order a stencil from a manufacturer. I recommend [OSH Stencils](https://www.oshstencils.com/).

Additionally, you should have a solid understanding of circuit theory, hardware prototyping, and test & measurement 
in order to debug the assembled circuit if the need arises.

The PCBs are sold in new, unused condition, but
they may have minor cosmetic issues like scuff marks or scratches due to handling. This should not impact the functionality of the device.

ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY is provided. I am not responsible if the device that you assemble does not work.
