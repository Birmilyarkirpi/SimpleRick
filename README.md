Low-cost 2D ultrasound imaging

## Introduction
_“Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick's.”_

Based on kelu124’s [un0rick](http://un0rick.cc/), this project aims to provide hardware and software to perform 2D ultrasound imaging
at a cost affordable for hobbyists/makers.To accomplish this, I’ve made a number of simplifications and modifications such as: 
* removing the FPGA and its supporting circuitry
* using cheaper parts wherever possible
* reducing board size

Of course, these changes come at the expensive of flexibility and extensibility.
If all you want to do is get ultrasound images onto your computer as cheaply as possible,this project is for you.
If you want to do anything fancy like real-time processing, sophisticated motor control, integration with other sensors,
standalone capability, etc. then you’ll be better served by un0rick.

More to come soon!
